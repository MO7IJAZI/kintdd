      "coccidiosisDesc": "Coccidiosis is one of the most serious poultry diseases worldwide. For many years, the problem of coccidiosis has been solved by the use of chemoprophylaxis.",
      "coccidiosisSolution": "Due to the increasing resistance of these parasites to existing solutions, it is reasonable to use plant-extract-based products with proven anti-coccidial effect as a preventative measure. KOKCIDIN® is a composition of carefully selected natural plant extracts demonstrating prophylactic anti-coccidial activity.",
      "coccidiosisMechanism": "The composition of KOKCIDIN® was developed and analysed by a team of experts in poultry nutrition. Its formulation demonstrates bacteriostatic and immunostimulatory activity. It may also be implemented as a solution to the problem of increased protozoal resistance to standard pharmaceuticals and consumer expectations regarding the quality of poultry meat and eggs. The positive effect of KOKCIDIN® is not only due to its direct effects on the parasites, but also results from the complex, broad activity of the compounds it contains. Among others effects, the stabilisation of bacterial flora (bacteriostatic activity), the stimulation of intestinal villi regeneration, the alleviation of intestinal inflammation, and the activation of immune processes have been confirmed."

      "ketosisSolution": "The ideal solution is the administration of glucoplastic substances which increase blood glucose content and reduce the concentration of ketone bodies, supplementation with vitamins (niacin and choline) which regulate fat metabolism pathways and prevent fatty liver syndrome, as well as supplementation with vitamin E, zinc, and selenium, which stimulate the cow’s resistance to infections."

      "quickStartSolution": "Research on sodium butyrate show its capability to accelerate the development of the intestinal villi and inhibit the growth of bacteria from the Enterobacteriaceae family. Moreover, young animals are very sensitive to deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins. Therefore, it is necessary to provide them with products which are rich in amino acids, fatty acid salts and ADEK vitamins. This accelerates the development of the animals and decreases future fattening time."

This information refers not only to the temperature range at which the active ingredient is effective, but also to the temperature at which the treatment can be safely applied to plants.",
      "desc2": "Temperatures below the optimum will slow the uptake of ingredients from the solution and reduce the effectiveness of the applied product.",
      "desc3": "At temperatures above 25°C, there is an increased risk of plant tissue damage due to rapid evaporation of water from the solution applied to the leaves.
